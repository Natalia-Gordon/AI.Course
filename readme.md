In our research, we gathered a dataset of 1503 records from a medical hospital using a
questionnaire administered through a Google form. This dataset has not yet been published.
Our dataset includes 15 attributes, where I select 10 attributes, 9 of which were used for
analysis and 1 of which was the target attribute. The target attribute, "Feeling Anxious,"
was chosen as a predictor of postpartum depression.
