- **Extracted Contexts:** 
  1. On April 13, 2024, a residential robbery occurred at Jennifer Lawson's home at 45 Elm Street, Springfield, while she was away on a weekend trip. The house was locked and the security system was armed before her departure on April 12. High-value items were stolen, and evidence of forced entry was found.

  2. On April 13, 2024, between 8:00 PM and 10:00 PM, a robbery occurred at a Colorado home. The house was secured at 7:00 AM, and a neighbor was notified to collect mail. Surveillance logs indicated a motion alert in the backyard, but the floodlight was disabled, and the backdoor showed forced entry without triggering the alarm, likely due to a signal jammer. Upon returning home on April 14 at 5:35 PM, the homeowner discovered a broken side gate, an open backdoor, and several missing items, prompting a call to the police at 6:00 PM.
  3. On April 15, 2024, Officer Daniels arrived at 6:45 PM to take inventory and photographs following a reported theft.

The police report number is SPD-041424-887. A review of the ADT home security system revealed that it failed to register an alarm during the incident due to a brief loss of connection with sensors at 8:13 PM.
  4. On April 16, a technician found that a security panel lost connection with sensors at 8:13 PM, likely due to an RF jammer, and no footage was recorded due to a cut DVR cable.
