  2. On April 13, 2024, between 8:00 PM and 10:00 PM, a robbery occurred at a Colorado home. The house was secured at 7:00 AM, and a neighbor was notified to collect mail. Surveillance logs indicated a motion alert in the backyard, and the floodlight activated before the power was cut. Evidence of forced entry was found at the backdoor, but no alarm was triggered, suggesting the use of a signal jammer. Upon returning home on April 14 at 5:35 PM, the homeowner discovered a broken side gate, an open backdoor, and several missing items, prompting a call to the police at 6:00 PM.

The police report number is SPD-041424-887. A review of the ADT home security system revealed that it failed to register an alarm during the incident due to a brief loss of connection with sensors at 8:13 PM.
