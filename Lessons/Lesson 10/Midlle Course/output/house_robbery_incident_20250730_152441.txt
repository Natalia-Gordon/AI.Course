- **Incident Type:** Residential Robbery  

**Key Events:**
- **April 12, 2024:** Jennifer Lawson departed her home at 6:45 AM for a weekend trip to Denver, Colorado. At 7:00 AM, she locked the house and armed the security system. At 7:15 AM, she informed her neighbor, Mr. Hayward, to collect any delivered mail.
- **April 13, 2024:** A robbery occurred at the residence while it was unoccupied. Evidence of forced entry was found, and several high-value items were stolen. The estimated time of the robbery was between 8:00 PM and 10:00 PM. Surveillance logs indicated a motion alert in the backyard, and the backyard floodlight was activated, but power was cut shortly after. Evidence of forced entry was found at the backdoor, showing crowbar marks. No alarm was triggered, suggesting the suspect may have used a signal jammer.
