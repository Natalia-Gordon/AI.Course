Please analyze the following PDF: {pdf_path}

1. Use Map-Reduce summarization to summarize the document.
2. Extract the intermediate summaries (Map phase) and treat them as context.
3. Evaluate the accuracy of the summary using RAGAS's Answer Accuracy metric.

To call the evaluation tool, provide a JSON string with the following format:
{{
  "question": "{question}",
  "ground_truth": "{ground_truth}",
  "summary": "<the summary from step 1>",
  "contexts": <list of texts from step 2>
}}

Return the final summary, the extracted contexts, and the evaluation score.
