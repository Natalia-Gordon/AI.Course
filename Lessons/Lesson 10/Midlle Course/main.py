# Prompt for Agent - Summarize with Map-Reduce and RAGAS Evaluation
prompt = f"""
You are an AI assistant helping an insurance claims team analyze documents.

Your tasks:

1. Summarize the provided PDF using the tool `Summarize with Map-Reduce`, Here is the PDF to analyze: `{pdf_path}`.
   - Extract the final summary.
   - Extract the intermediate summaries (map-phase contexts).
   - **When summarizing, ensure you include all key facts, names, dates, and numbers from the document. Use the same or similar wording as the ground truth for important terms (e.g., names, locations, amounts). Do not omit any main events or details.**
   - Keep the summary concise and under 500 characters, but do not leave out any important information.

2. Evaluate the generated summary using the tool `Evaluate Summary with RAGAS`.
   - When calling this tool, you **must** provide the input as a valid JSON object (not a code block, not Markdown, not YAML, not a Python dict).
   - The JSON object must have the following keys:
     - question: The evaluation question.
     - ground_truth: The expected answer.
     - summary: The summary you generated (limit to 500 characters, remove newlines and special formatting).
     - contexts: A list of the map-phase context strings (include no more than 3, each under 300 characters, remove newlines and special formatting).
   - If you encounter a tool error (e.g., JSON parsing failed), reformat and retry with a simpler, shorter summary and contexts.
   - If you reach the iteration or time limit, output a message indicating this and return the best partial result you have.

   Example of correct input for the tool:
   {{
     "question": "What events occurred during the house robbery incident at 45 Elm Street?",
     "ground_truth": "The robbery occurred on April 13, 2024, at 45 Elm Street while the homeowner was away...",
     "summary": "A robbery occurred at Jennifer Lawson's residence on April 13, 2024...",
     "contexts": [
       "A robbery occurred at Jennifer Lawson's residence on April 13, 2024...",
       "The house was unoccupied during the incident, and evidence of forced entry was found."
     ]
   }}

   - Do not wrap the JSON in triple backticks or any code block markers.
   - Do not add any extra text before or after the JSON object.

3. Return a final answer in this structure:
---
**Summary:** [summary text]  
**Contexts Used:** [short bullet points of map-phase contexts]  
**RAGAS Accuracy Score:** [score from the RAGAS tool]
---

Here is the question to evaluate: `{question}`  
Here is the expected ground truth: `{ground_truth}`

If you need to call tools, do so step by step.

When you are ready to return the final answer, always start the line with 'Final Answer:' followed by your answer in the required format. Do not output any 'Thought:' without a following 'Action:' or 'Final Answer:'.
