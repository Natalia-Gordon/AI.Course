Security System Review
My ADT home security system typically activates an alarm when any exterior entry is forced. In
this case, no alarm was registered. Upon technician review on April 16, it was concluded that:
 The security panel lost connection with sensors briefly at 8:13 PM.
 Signal interference was likely caused by an RF jammer.
 No footage was captured due to DVR cable cut from the outside.
Suspected Entry Point
The backdoor is the most likely entry route. Damaged lock and crowbar markings were
observed. No broken glass, suggesting a deliberate and planned breach. Neighbor’s dog barked at
approximately 8:20 PM, according to his statement, suggesting movement near the rear fence.

are stored. My insurance coverage will be reviewed for an optional rider for high-value
electronics and jewelry.
